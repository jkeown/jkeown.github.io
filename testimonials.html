      <p>“Highly Recommended” We have used the "Cowboy Movers" twice and have found them to be very professional, friendly, courteous and hard working. 
      They have great attitudes, show up on time, have great energy, and are very respectful. Whenever we hear that someone is moving, we never hesitate to 
      recommend the "Cowboy Movers" to them. From the top down they are a “Great Moving Company with Great Movers and Great Service”.

      <p>This is the second time I've moved with the help of The Cowboy Movers and the next time we move I will be calling them again. They're fast and friendly,
      everything got to our new location safely and in record time. These guys are great and I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. (02/22/11)</p>

      <p>Steve did a great job sending over a crew that packed and moved me and he had a days notice. I supplied the packing stuff. The thing that I would most use him for 
      again is he was the cheapest bid; his crew was very professional; and most of all, I had a piece of furniture that was damaged and he stood completely behind it and 
      fixed it within two weeks of my move in date. Thanks! (01/11)</p>

      <p>I would like to thank Cowboy Movers for the professional and efficient service provided by Jake and Randy. They arrived on time and worked dilligently and quickly 
      throughout my move. I relocated from a second story condo to a third floor apartment and they made the move seem effortless. They disassembled and reassembled 
      furniture, treated everything with the utmost care and were cordial and polite during the entire process. I would highly recommend Cowboy Movers and would definately 
      use them again in the future. Thank you! (12/17/10)</p>

      <p>FANTASTIC! STELLAR! STUPENDOUS! Darren, Jake and Carsten were spectacular. These gentlemen are by far the best movers we have ever had. (And we've moved 8 times 
      in the last 14 years) On time, professional, terrific upbeat attitude in spite of an AFRICA HOT HEAT, they worked effectively as a team and made a stressful day 
      a fun and productive day. We heartily recommend this trio who was courteous, hard working and fun! Nothing was damaged, they took great care to protect our hard wood 
      floors, they HUSTLED, they packed the truck fantastically, smiled all day, EARNED OUR ADMIRATION! At the end of the day - I was sad to see them go! I HATE MOVING - but
      I would be happy to do it again, with this team. They made it worth it! We will absolutely call these gentlemen when we move again. THANK YOU DARREN, JAKE AND CARSTEN 
      - YOU MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE FOR OUR FAMILY TODAY! (09/03/10)</p>

      <p>Jerry and I want to compliment our movers, Larry and Jake, on the wonderful job they did for us this past Friday. They were professional, personable, and they took
      very good care of our things. We used the Cowboy Movers three years ago for our first move to Southern California, and our experience was great - we were so happy to 
      see that the essence of the Cowboys has remained true. We will continue to recommend the Cowboy Movers to our friends and family, and we will definitely use them again 
      for any future moves. All the best! (07/01/10)</p>

      <p>Chaz, Dalton, and Smitty were AWESOME!!! They were professional, courteous and hardworking. I was very impressed with their work ethic and attention to detail. 
      They were very careful with my belongings and took maxium advantage of the storage space available. I will definitely use Cowboy Movers again when the time comes. 
      Thanks so much for the excellent job! (03/21/10)</p>

      <p>Bob and I can't thank you enough for the smooth move we had to our new place in beautiful Tennessee. there aren't enough words to say how we feel about Darren 
      and Jake. we hated dropping them off at the airport in Knoxville. Our 3 experiences with them was such a pleasure. We would have kept them here if we could have. 
      Steve, we will have no hestitation recommending Cowboy Movers for local or long distance. It was so nice to finally be able to put a face to the voice on the phone. 
      Sincere regards..Bob & Julie (03/08/10)</p>

      <p>The helpers you sent were the best! I was very happy with everything they did, great personalities and hard workers. I will use your services again and will 
      recommend Cowboy Movers to others. (02/20/10)</p>

      <p>Chas and Jake arrived right on time and were excellent workers! We got moved in record time and nothing got broken or damaged. These two guys really know how to
      pack the moving truck to maximize the space. Chas even used his pick-up truck to haul the last few items that wouldn't fit in the moving truck. This was the second 
      time we used Cowboy Movers, and we would use them again in a heartbeat. Thank you Chas and Jake! (02/19/10)</p>

      <p>I had to drive some furniture from Fresno to a condo in Corona and from one apartment in Corona to the condo. I HIGHLY recommend Cowboy Movers. They were quick,
      careful, helpful with suggestions, on time for the job and very reasonably priced. I had to have furniture moved upstairs and they did a great job!

      <p>OMG, the move could not have gone any better. We were so impressed with the way Steve, Jake and Ron protected our furnishings and loaded them so carefully. Then 
      to drive to Illinois and unload and setup with the same amount of care. What a professional team. Nothing was lost or broken. Just amazing. We would recommend "Cowboy 
      Movers" to any and all. (11/30/09)</p>

      <p>Jake and Joe moved two loads of a 14' U-Haul truck in under 2 hours, and were friendly and professional all the way. Highly recommended!

      <p>I would definitely recommend Cowboy Movers to help you move. Jake and Carsten worked very hard completing the move quickly. They were very friendly, prompt,
      and efficient. Very good job! (10/23/09)</p>
